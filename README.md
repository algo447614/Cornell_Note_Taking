# Note_Taking
Personal note taking app that I use for school. Program follows Cornell Note-taking System logic, where the program prompts for progress by next paragraph or next chapter. Main screen separates each entry by Course --> chapter --> and inner paragraph(s). 

Login screen allows for username and password entry to protect notes.
  Main screen first separates by course code;; all course codes listed. 
    User double-clicks course code, or enters new. 
      Inside course is chapters. User double-clicks chapter, or goes to next.
        Inside chapter are paragraphs. User double-clicks paragraph or goes to next. 

Program allows for summary of all notes, or summary and edit-ability through double-click on title of entry. Program also allows for text export of files.
